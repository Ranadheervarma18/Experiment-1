# Experiment-1

## Aim
To do the **DC analysis, Transient analysis, and AC analysis** of a **Common Source (CS) amplifier** circuit and extract various parameters using **LT Spice**.

## Components Required
- **Mosfet:** `nmos4`, `pmos4`
- **Resistor:** `22kÎ©`
- **Voltage Supply:** `1.8V`, `0.9V`
- **Connecting Wires**

## Theory
**MOSFET** is one of the most important components in electronics.

This importance is due to:
- Compact design  
- Low power consumption  
- Simple geometry  
- Compatibility in **VLSI technology**

### MOSFET Configurations
There are three different configurations in which the MOSFET can be connected:
1. **Common Drain**
2. **Common Gate**
3. **Common Source** *(Most popular)*

The **MOSFET acts as an amplifier** in the **saturation region**, where:
- `Vgs > Vth`
- `Vgd < Vth`
- `Vds â‰¥ Vov` *(For N-channel MOSFET)*

In the **Common Source configuration**:
- There is a **180-degree phase shift** between input and output.
- The **input impedance is very high** *(Ideally infinite, `Ig = 0`)*.

### Drain Current Equation
\[
Id = \frac{1}{2} k_n V_{ov}^2
\]
where:  
- **\(V_{ov} = V_{gs} - V_{th}\)**
- **\( k_n = \mu_n C_{ox} \frac{W}{L} \)**  

### Output Consideration
The output is taken from the **drain end**, rather than simply across the resistor, to maintain a **common ground reference**.

## Analysis Types

### **1. DC Analysis**
- Ensures the MOSFET operates in the **saturation region**.
- Determines the **DC operating point** of the transistor.
- Prevents **signal distortion**.
- Helps in the **determination of biasing resistors**.
- Maintains a **correct operating point** despite parameter fluctuations.

### **2. Transient Analysis**
- Analyzes the response of the circuit to **time-varying signals**.
- Helps determine:
  - **Signal distortion**
  - **DC shift between input and output**
  - **Phase distortion issues**
- Essential for **high-speed applications** (e.g., communication systems).

### **3. AC Analysis**
- Small signal analysis of the circuit.
- Determines the **gain** of the amplifier circuit.
- Helps analyze the **frequency response**.
- Gain is given by:

\[
A_v = -g_m R_d
\]

## **Calculation**  

### **Power Calculation**  
\[
P = 100ÂµW
\]

### **Drain Equation**  
\[
VDD = VDS + ID \times RD
\]

\[
P = I \times V
\]

- **Given:**  
  - `ID = 48.33ÂµA`  
  - `VDD = 1.8V`  
- **Thus:**  
  \[
  VDS = Vout
  \]

### **Resistor and MOSFET Parameters**
- **Calculated RD:** `32.4kÎ©` *(Used: `22kÎ©`)*  
- **Length:** `180nm`  
- **Width:** `18Âµm` *(Found by keeping the length constant)*  
- **VDS:** `0.735V`  

### **Q-Point**
\[
Q = (0.735V, 48.33ÂµA)
\]

## Inference

1. The width of the MOSFET directly affects the drain current.  
2. By changing the dimensions of the MOSFET:  
   - **M1 (PMOS):** Varying the width causes only a slight change in drain current.  
   - **M2 (NMOS):** Increasing the width significantly increases the drain current.  
3. A larger MOSFET width results in a higher gain.  
4. There is a **180-degree phase shift** between the input and output waveforms.
